A game made for me and my wisses for learning

The game is an RPG
It has cities
The cities has a markedplace, a store, hunt board. 
It's where you can upgrade the charachter stats with books.
The books contains upgrade for one stat to a charachter.
The books can be bought on the markedplace.

hunts is a challange for you and your charachter. 
stats need to be right and you need to be ready for
a challange:
  - buttom mash press
  - a word/sentence echo quickly
  - a quiz
  - math
  - logic quiz IQ

The books and money gets obtain by a hunt success
picks a random book, *always* an upgrade for a stat.
The book can be listed on markedplace for money.
The cities have special kinds of random books = stats for upgrades, 
each city has therefore specilized stats you can get.

For the future:
Could do a live pvp, get from it money.
More GUI.
More Challanges.
More MMO
